as we are not using scope resolution operator nor the using namespace keyword so the compiler will fail to compile and will give the error<br>
of undeclared identifier as the scope of the identifier will not be defined so the code will be able to pass the preprocessor phase of the <br>
compiler but it will not pass the compilation phase of the compiler and therefore it will generate an error.<br>
